# Project-Euler-Solutions

This entire project gives solutions to project euler questions in java explaining what's going on and annotates the codes roughly to see what each part of the code does (this is done by the comments with //). The purpose of project euler is for solution alogirthms to solve mathematical puzzles in the form of computing that would take approximately a few seconds only (preferably 1 second) where for humans that could take a very long time, potentially forever.
